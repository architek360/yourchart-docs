Getting Started
===============

To get started, you'll first need access to the API Client of your choice's source code.
To get access to the source, please contact `Michael Wasser <http://about.me/mwasser>`_ at Gocodo.
Once you have access, you will be able to use the language specific documentation along with the
documentation in the :doc:`Calls <calls>` and :doc:`Models <models>` sections to connect to and
interact with patient records.
