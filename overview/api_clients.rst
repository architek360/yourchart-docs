API Clients
===========

To make it easier for software developers to get quick and secure access to patient records, API clients have been provided
for use by Gocodo under an MIT license. Please contact `Michael Wasser <http://about.me/mwasser>`_ at Gocodo for access to the
API clients. Currently, the API client is written in the following languages:

  * Javascript with Node.js
  * .Net
  * Objective-C

If you would like support for additional languages, please contact `Michael Wasser <http://about.me/mwasser>`_ at Gocodo.
Writing additional clients are relatively strait forward and can generally be completed in less than two days.
