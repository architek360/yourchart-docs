Data
====

A wide array of different types of patient data are available through the use of the |project|. For example:

* Immunization history
* Allergies
* Lab results
* Current medications
* Patient facing notes, orders, diagnosis, and medications from a medical encounter (such as a preventative visit)
* Lab results
* Current problems list

This data is made available by hospitals by the MyChart Mobile webservice. Given a location, a username, and a password, and a patients permission, a developer can fetch all of the above information. See the :doc:`Models section <../models>` for a more complete description of the data made available.
