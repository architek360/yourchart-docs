YourChart Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |project| was originally built while working with a Hospital System
running Epic MyChart. They wanted to build a PHR for themselves that was
more feature rich and usable than the MyChart Mobile application. The
first step was to figure out how we could access patient data in a secure
way within our own application at low cost to the hospital itself. This
client library started as a proof of concept with a related mobile application
for that hospital system. Since then, Gocodo has decided to open source the
client library in an effort to improve healthcare in the US by enabling
application developers to create applications unlike we've seen before.
