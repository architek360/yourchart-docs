MyChart Test logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're always looking for more MyChart logins to test with. The more sample data we have, the more complete
the clients will become. If you find a hosptial you are working with has more data or capabilities
than is currently available in the client, `let us know <http://about.me/mwasser>`_. If you are willing
to provide a set of MyChart logins to test with, we may be able to quickly add more functionality to the
client.

If you'd like to contribute code back to the project, please take a look at the 
`Gocodo YourChart Client codebase <https://https://github.com/gocodo/yourchart-client-generator>`_. 
Each client library is autogenerated using the code there. To get started, install Node.js version 0.10 or greater
and run

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install
    node make

The client libraries will be outputted to ``./build``. If you think others would benifit from your code, send a pull request on github.
